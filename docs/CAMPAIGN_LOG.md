# Campaign Log

## 2026-06-07

- Created this public record repository.
- Imported the first Gemma 4 benchmark reports.
- Added the initial diagnosis and solution plan.
- Added first-pass tools:
  - `scripts/spark_doctor.py`
  - `scripts/gguf_logprobs_probe.py`
  - `scripts/openai_chat_smoke.py`
- Added SGLang as a first-class runtime workstream after reviewing `hikarioyama/sglang-nvfp4-kv-sm120`.
- Added LiteRT-LM and practical llama.cpp serving as first-class runtime workstreams.
- Added the upstream fork/submodule/worktree policy for patched libraries.
- Added before/after GB10 benchmark protocol for measuring campaign impact.
- Added NVFP4 dependency map from the FlashInfer/vLLM/SGLang subagent investigation.
- Added a compact OpenAI-compatible serving benchmark harness and captured the first vLLM before row.
- Added root-readable runtime process probe evidence for the live vLLM server.
- Reproduced the llama.cpp GGUF logprobs incompatibility with a temporary `llama-server` on port `18081`; server was stopped after the probe.
- Captured runtime availability matrix showing vLLM/FlashInfer/PyTorch present, SGLang and LiteRT-LM absent, Docker available, and llama.cpp built but not on `PATH`.
- Started tracking work through GitHub Issues.
- Ran `spark_doctor` on `thinkstationpgx-00b4` using `/home/jethac/gemma4-evals/.venv/bin/python`.

## First Benchmark Campaign Summary

The first campaign was run on `thinkstationpgx-00b4` in `/home/jethac/gemma4-evals`.

At the last local sync:

- smoke rows: 152 complete
- smoke `ok`: 21
- smoke `eval_failed`: 11
- smoke `loader_failed`: 120
- full eval records: 70
- full eval `ok`: 65
- full eval failed: 5
- throughput rows observed: 2
- MTP rows observed: 2

The campaign was still in full accuracy when monitoring stopped. It was not killed.
